# DIMWishList
Personal wish list of destiny weapons and perks I'm looking for. Used with the [DIM (Destiny Item Manager)](https://app.destinyitemmanager.com/), found on GitHub [here](https://github.com/DestinyItemManager).

To use, copy the GitHub url of the raw (thinking_be_gone.txt)[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tompnyx/DIMWishList/main/thinking_be_gone.txt] file into DIM's 'Add another wish list' section, and click the '+Add Wish List' button.

The following spreadsheets/information sources have been used as a basis for generating this combined sheet:

A resource available from [Aegis's public Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AL3GM6rSSrm4LtSZeayxpSUsvSJdsiU3). Note that only S and A weapons are listed.
